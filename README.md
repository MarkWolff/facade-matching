# Regularity Driven Facade Matching

### Abstract 
We present an approach for detecting and matching
building facades between aerial view and street-view images.
We exploit the regularity of urban scene facades
as captured by their lattice structures and deduced from
median-tilesâ€™ shape context, color, texture and spatial similarities.
Our experimental results demonstrate effective
matching of oblique and partially-occluded facades between
aerial and ground views. Quantitative comparisons
for automated urban scene facade matching from three
cities show superior performance of our method over baseline
SIFT, Root-SIFT and the more sophisticated ScaleSelective
Self-Similarity and Binary Coherent Edge descriptors.
We also illustrate regularity-based applications of
occlusion removal from street views and higher-resolution
texture-replacement in aerial views.
